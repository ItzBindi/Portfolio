        <p>Hey my name is Suraj Nair! I was born and raised in the suburbs of chicago. I grew up a huge football and basketball fan! My favorite teams are the Bears and the Suns! I also have a love for music with my top artists being J Cole, Drake, and Lil wayne. I also am an avid gamer! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently I am pursuing becoming a developer and am studying at Northwestern University! I am enrolled in their coding bootcamp with hopes of at the end being able to land a career in the development field that I can thrive in! I am a realy hard worker, reliable, can work very well independently or with a team, and I am very friendly. I am always looking to improve and am always willing to learn new things! </p>
